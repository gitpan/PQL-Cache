Scalar-Validation version 0.700
==============================

PQL::Cache - A mini in memory database using pure perl and PQL -
PerlQueryLanguage - to store hashes and objects.

It can be dumped and saved into a single file, like a simple hash
containing objects.

PQL is similar to DBIx::Class API, so switching to DBIx and SQL
databases is possible.

It uses pure Perl (no compilation needed), so you can run it from a
USB stick.

Using of object get-subs for column values waits for implementation.
Currently only direct access per hash key is supported.
